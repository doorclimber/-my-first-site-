<h2>Hello Everyone! My name is Robert King. Welcome to my site! It's a personal project of mine. <br>
I wanted to create a simple social media site where users can post text-based content, and follow friends to view other content. <br>
It was built using the Django framework. The backend is written with Python and MySQL, while the frontend is HTML and CSS. <br>
Sign up and have a look around!</h2>
